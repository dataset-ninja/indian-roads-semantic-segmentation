**Semantic Segmentation Dataset of Indian Roads** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 3227 images with 8129 labeled objects belonging to 4 different classes including *road*, *footpath*, *shallow*, and other: *pothole*.

Images in the Indian Roads dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation (only one mask for every class) or object detection (bounding boxes for every object) tasks. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *train* (2475 images) and *val* (752 images). The dataset was released in 2021 by the e-Yantra, IIT Bombay, India.
